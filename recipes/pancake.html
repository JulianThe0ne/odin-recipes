  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>These sour cream pancakes have a butter crisp outside and the inside is so soft it’s almost creamy.
  To balance the flavor of the sour cream, I added more sugar. So these are actually sweeter pancakes than most. So good!</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>Butter for greasing the pan -about 3 tablespoons</li>
    <li>Maple syrup for serving</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, add the milk, sour cream, sugar, eggs, and vanilla. Whisk until combined. It’s ok to have small lumps of sour cream.</li>
    <li>Add the flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir just until no large clumps of dry flour remain, trying not to over mix. The batter should be very lumpy.</li>
    <li>Melt about ½ tablespoon of butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium-low heat until lightly bubbling and light brown.</li>
    <li>Ladle the batter into the skillet making 3-4 pancakes (about ¼ cup of batter each). Cook 3-4 minutes, until bubbles form on top of each pancake and the bottoms are golden brown.</li>
    <li>Flip the pancakes. Cook 1-2 minutes, until the bottoms are golden brown.</li>
    <li>Carefully wipe out any excess browned butter with paper towels. Repeat with the remaining butter and pancake batter.</li>
    <li>Serve warm with maple syrup.</li>
  </ol>
