# odin-recipes
I'm here doing the foundations of the Odin Project to get back to some basics we didn't had time to explore during the bootcamp I did.
I can go through each lesson at my pace which is ideal to remember all this little things of how everything works and I am enjoying myself in this process. #No rush
